The Cloud Marketplace Shared Responsibility Model (V1.0)
🌐 View the Interactive Framework
📌 Overview
Cloud marketplaces have evolved from niche channels to critical enterprise procurement platforms, projected to reach $163B by 2030. However, the traditional "Shared Responsibility Model" for infrastructure (managing security of vs. in the cloud) does not address the complexity of marketplace transactions .

This project introduces a Three-Party Shared Responsibility Model to define accountability across Cloud Providers, Vendors, and Enterprise Customers .

🏗 The Three-Party Model
Unlike infrastructure, marketplace procurement is a business-process-centric coordination challenge.
+1


Cloud Provider (Platform Layer): Responsible for discovery, billing infrastructure, and platform security .


Third-Party Vendor (Product Layer): Responsible for software functionality, product security, and private offer creation .


Customer Organization (Governance Layer): Responsible for the "Coordination Gap"—aligning 9+ internal teams, security assessments, and P2P integration .
+1

⚖️ Why This Repository Exists
Enterprises are currently facing "Organizational Gridlock".


The Problem: Manual coordination across 9+ teams results in 3–6 week transaction delays.
+1


The Solution: A Marketplace Center of Excellence (MCoE) and automated coordination infrastructure .


The Goal: Move the industry from "Ad Hoc" manual processes to "Marketplace-Native" automation where pre-approved tools can be deployed in hours.
