## 📌 Overview
Cloud marketplaces are the fastest-growing enterprise technology channels in history, yet they shift execution responsibilities in ways that traditional infrastructure models do not address. 

This project defines a **Three-Party Shared Responsibility Model**—moving beyond the two-party (AWS/Customer) infrastructure model to a coordination-centric framework for **Cloud Providers, Third-Party Vendors, and Enterprise Customers**.

## 🏗️ The Responsibility Layers

### 1. Cloud Provider (Platform Layer)
The CSP (AWS, Azure, GCP) owns the marketplace infrastructure.
* **Discovery & Search**: Catalog management and vendor listings.
* **Transaction Infrastructure**: Payment processing and billing aggregation.
* **Governance Capabilities**: IAM frameworks and Private Marketplace tools.

### 2. Third-Party Vendor (Product Layer)
The Independent Software Vendor (ISV) owns the product lifecycle.
* **Product Security**: Application security and vulnerability management.
* **Private Offer Creation**: Custom pricing and negotiated terms.
* **Updates & Maintenance**: Patches and functionality.

### 3. Customer Organization (Governance & Workflow Layer)
The Enterprise buyer owns the most complex layer: Internal Coordination.
* **The Coordination Gap**: Aligning 9+ teams (Legal, Finance, Security, etc.) for every transaction.
* **Security Assessment**: Direct execution of vendor due diligence.
* **P2P Integration**: Connecting marketplace data to ERP systems (Coupa, SAP, etc.).

## ⚖️ Why Contribute?
Currently, "Ad Hoc" manual coordination results in **3–6 week delays** per transaction. By standardizing this model, we aim to:
1.  Establish a **Marketplace Center of Excellence (MCoE)** framework.
2.  Reduce procurement friction for AI/ML adoption.
3.  Shift from manual handoffs to **Marketplace-Native automation**.

## 🤝 How to Contribute
This is an **Open Framework**. We invite collective insight from the industry to refine these definitions.
